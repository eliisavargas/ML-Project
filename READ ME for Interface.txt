READ ME for Interface

To save correctly:
- save the Model file and the FLASK App into a folder.
- then create a subfolder for templates for all HTML templates.

OR
- just download the Folder from GitHub as it is and keep the structure

To run correctly:
- Because of the file sizes, you Need to run the model to create the pickle files
- Please Keep the pickle file in the same Folder as the model and FLASK app

- FINALLY: Run the FLASK App -> prediction interface will open automatically
